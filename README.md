  # Arch-Linux-Customization
</p>

>[!Note]
I love customizing my own desktop experience and with arch it seems like everything is easily customizable

Python is a programming language i love, with it i can create a bunch of scripts i can customize my experience. 

This repo will aslo include all the other programs i use, such as fastfetch, waybar and my hyprland config files.
