## Kitty
A blazing fast terminal that i recommend everyone uses. 


### Testing & Building

This is very important, instead of shutting down your device and rebooting it to see your changes to your configuration, you can use a `settings.json` file which i provided to change your kitty terminal when you `save your configuration file`. 

This is ofcourse fo visual studio code. If you are using vim and neovim steps can be written with a command.
