## FastFetch

Having Fast Fetch is a great way to start customizing your kitty terminal. This section could have been placed under kitty but i wanted it as its own section. 


Fast Fetch is just a creative way in order to see all of your machine specs.

You can see my config in the file located in the same directory. 


### Logo

For the logo i recommend that you set up only the URL inside the `jsonc` file and setup up the styles when running the command.

`fastfetch --logo-height 20 --logo-width 50 --logo-position left`

This is my command placed inside the `fish shell config file`. Please make sure what shell you have. Run `echo $SHELL` inside your terminal.
